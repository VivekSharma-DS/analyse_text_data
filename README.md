# analyse_text_data
Comparison of behavior of LSA and LDA on Text data containing emotions
In this, we used to form the groups of similar text from the tweets. The aim is to form groups of each sentiment which can be done by Topic modelling techniques; as they form a group of text by identifying hidden topics. In this, two topic modelling techniques- Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Latent Semantic Analysis will be implemented on textual data and results will be compared for both the techniques.
